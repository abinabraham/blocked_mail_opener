# Awesome! Retrieving Gmail blocked attachments

> The way showing below

So the whole attachment was contained in that text file, encoded in base64! Now I just needed to extract it from the email and convert it back to binary.

## Examples
- Save this to a file named mail_opener.py and, after saving the original message to a file named mail.txt run python mail_opener.py mail.txt and youâ€™ll see the attachments of your email in the same folder!
